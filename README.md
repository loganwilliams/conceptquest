## Conceptquest

* You are a person.
* That's what you're told.
* But you don't know what to do.
* You need to practice.

Conceptquest is an interactive hypertext game based on the strange and wonderful world of [the ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io).

**Warning:** the ConceptNet dataset contains unfiltered, crowdsourced language. Some data might be offensive or disturbing, so use discretion. On the other hand, we're training natural language models with this stuff, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Launching

Conceptquest can be launched in development mode by running `yarn start`. To build a minified version for production, run `yarn build`.
